# laravel-application-testing
Functional testing for laravel 5.7+, perhaps even 5.4+, [like "interacting with your application" in laravel 5.3](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/application-testing#interacting-with-your-application) (copied from it). Use InteractsWithPages trait on your tests to use this.
